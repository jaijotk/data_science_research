```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If surveys.csv, species.csv, and plots.csv are not available in your workspace download them, and load them into R using read.csv().

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("../data-raw/surveys.csv")
species <- read.csv("../data-raw/species.csv")
plots <- read.csv("../data-raw/plots.csv")
```

Write a function that:
Takes three arguments - a data frame (the combined table created before), a genus name, and a species name,
Uses functions from the dplyr package to produce a data frame with two columns: year and count, where count is the number of individuals (i.e., the number of rows) for the species indicated by genus and species in that year,
Returns the resulting data frame. Note that this data frame is a time series by year.
