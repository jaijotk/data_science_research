# Go into groups and compare the paths you used to save the subsets of data_table in the data folder, and answer:

#   Did you use relative or absolute paths?
#   We used relative paths to save the subsets of data_table in the data folder. This is because they are relative to another thing. In other words, it looks like  a partial path because the computer knows how to interpret the path. 

#   If you all used the absolute path to save any CSV file, what does the path look like? Do you all have the same path? What are the differences?
#   If we all used the absolute path to save any CSV file, the path looks like it started from the root and has specific directions on how to get to the location; for example, something like this: write.csv(first_subset, file = "~/Desktop/firsttenrows.csv". We do not all have the same path because the names of the locations within our computer are different. Therefore, the differences can be within the folder names, computer locations, user names, etc.

#   If you all used relative paths to save any of your CSV files, what does the path look like? Do you all have the same path? What are the differences?
#   If we all used relative paths to save any of the CSV files, the path looks like a very general code that can be utilized as they are relative to one another; for example, it looks something like this: write.csv(firsttenrows, file = "firsttenrows.csv"). We all have the same path because the path is determined by the computer's interpretation of the code. Therefore, everyone's code will be similar. The difference that may be seen is that the individual's may have saved the file under a different name, but because it is a relative path, the location would be the same.
